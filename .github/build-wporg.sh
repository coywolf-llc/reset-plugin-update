# build-wporg.sh — produce the WordPress.org-compliant variant of this plugin.
#
# The plugin ships from GitHub with a bundled self-updater that pulls its own
# updates from the project's GitHub Releases. The WordPress.org Plugin
# Directory forbids that — listed plugins must update through .org — so this
# script takes an already-staged build tree and strips the self-updater out,
# leaving an otherwise-identical plugin that updates through wordpress.org.
#
# What it removes:
#   * includes/class-github-updater.php          — the updater class file
#   * any  wporg-strip:start .. wporg-strip:end  region in the main PHP file
#     (the require + bootstrap of the updater)
#   * any  wporg-strip:start .. wporg-strip:end  region in readme.txt
#     (prose that advertises GitHub-based updating / outbound calls)
#   * readme.md                                  — .org consumes readme.txt only
#
# Usage:
#   .github/build-wporg.sh <src_dir> <out_dir>
#     <src_dir>  a tree already containing the runtime plugin files. In CI this
#                is the GitHub release stage, so the .git / .github / dev-tool
#                exclusions have already been applied — the .org variant is
#                exactly the GitHub build minus the updater.
#     <out_dir>  emptied and recreated; the variant is written to
#                <out_dir>/<slug>/  (slug = the stage dir's name).
